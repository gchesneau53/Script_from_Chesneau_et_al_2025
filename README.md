## Overview  

This repository contains all scripts and raw data tables used for generating the figures presented in the manuscript:  
**MetaFlowTrain: A Highly Parallelized and Modular Fluidic System for Studying Exometabolite-Mediated Inter-Organismal Interactions.**  

Each folder corresponds to one figure from the manuscript, with subfolders organized by individual figure panels.  

### Structure  

- **Figures**:  
  - Each **figure folder** contains:  
    - **Subfolders** for individual panels (e.g., `Figure1/panelA`, `Figure1/panelB`, etc.).  
    - Raw data tables (`.txt` or `.csv`) and associated scripts for each panel.  
  - Scripts are designed to reproduce the results with the raw data provided in the same folder.  

- **Excluded Table**:  
  - Due to size limitations on GitHub, the table for Figure 2, panel C.D (`df_untargeted.csv`) is not included here.  
  - This table is available upon request—please contact the corresponding author.

## Requirements  

To run the scripts, ensure the following are installed:  
- R (version ≥ 4.0) with necessary packages (listed within each script).

## How to Use  

1. Navigate to the folder corresponding to the desired figure and panel.  
2. Ensure the necessary software and dependencies are installed.  
3. Run the script provided in the folder to reproduce the results.  
4. Refer to the raw tables for input data.
